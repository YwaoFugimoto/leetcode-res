# ðŸ§  Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains my solutions to algorithm and data structure problems solved on platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and others.

The goal is to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and build a consistent study routine.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Practice logic and data structures
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Build a public record of continuous learning
- Refactor and optimize solutions over time
